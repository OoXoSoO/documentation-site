Lee Byron, Facebook\n Official Definition  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. graphql.org\n More specifically:  GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn\u0026rsquo;t tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. graphql.org/learn\n GraphQL at travelgateX GraphQL fits perfectly each and every need of our applications:\n Scalable: we must be able to handle millions of requests. Stable: a change in the API must not break the client. Fast: GraphQL not only allows faster response times by letting you choose exactly what you want, but also is consumes less bandwidth which makes responses lighter.  We\u0026rsquo;re a company focused in providing APIs for our clients. SOAP APIs are long gone and modelling REST APIs to fit a vast variety of products is not only hard, but the bigger it gets the more unmanageable.\nAt travelgateX, we\u0026rsquo;re true believers of the Kaisen philosophy. We\u0026rsquo;re constantly researching for new ways of improvement.\n GraphQL allows us to think of our APIs as a whole, giving a coherence in all our products \u0026amp; services, accessible from one single endpoint. It\u0026rsquo;s like a showcase for our APIs. Oscar Perez, CTO\n "

	"content": " Queries and Mutations  At its simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by looking at a very simple query and the result we get when we run it http://graphql.org/learn/queries/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com\n There are 2 basic operations in GraphQL schemas:\nQueries http://graphql.org/learn/queries/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com Just like a RESTful Get method, queries query the system. This operation reads values from the server using a Graph Object and gets a JSON as a response.\nUnlike a RESTful service, queries are interactive, it allows the user to choose exactly what he wants to get returned. This way, if the API owner makes a change to the API, the client will not be affected as long as the query does not change. Think of it like a good\u0026rsquo;ol SQL query. As long as you send the same one, the results is always predictable.\nThis fact makes versioning totally unnecessary in GraphQL APIs. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to specify which version you want to consume, since it\u0026rsquo;s you who are in charge of deciding which fields you want to retrieve.\nAs a bonus, the GraphQL specification includes handling of deprecated fields and marks a field as is-deprecated by adding a deprecationReason to the field.\nAn example query:\nEJEMPLO PEQUE DE DISPO TODO: Falta ejemplo!! Mutations http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com Mutations are methods that change the server. It makes a physical change to the data. Could be inserting a new object in a database, deleting or updating. Queries take care of POST, PUT and DELETE methods in a REST API or INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE in SQL.\nTODO: Falta chicha!! "

	"content": " A Paradigm Shift GraphQL is not a drop-in-replacement for REST APIs. It has to make sense to use it, it\u0026rsquo;s not a one size-fits-all technology.\nIn order to determine if it is the right tool for the job or not, we have to learn how to Think in GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language, and as such it does exactly that: it queries servers in order to get results back. And we get to choose exactly what data we want to retrieve. As opposed to JSON, each piece of data has its own type, so we get to know exactly what to expect, it\u0026rsquo;s a typed language. This gives it a lot of predictability, something we can really appreciate, especially when dealing with third party APIs, where we have no control of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the other side.\nBuilding GraphQL Schemas In GraphQL, the API specifications are called schemas. A GraphQL Schema is like a contract between the client and the server. It\u0026rsquo;s the definition of how they talk to each other, what they expect from each other so each of them can know exactly what they can and cannot send to each other and what they\u0026rsquo;ll get in response to that. This makes a lot of a difference when creating our schemas, we have to get used to think in a Schema First way.\n A particularly interesting pattern seems to be emerging. Over and over again, I hear developers describing a way of approaching product development we’re calling “GraphQL First.”https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-first-a-better-way-to-build-modern-apps-b5a04f7121a0\n First, we model our data, thinking of all the different uses we can give to it. And only then, we\u0026rsquo;ll think of where we going to get it from. It could even be from different services, like a database and another node from a third party provider.\nAnother great feature is that the GraphQL specification ensures we write documentation while writing the schema. Apart from being really cool to see your text in the GraphiQL window while you\u0026rsquo;re typing your query, it really helps you to think of each and every node and why you\u0026rsquo;re putting it there. We use APIs Guru\u0026rsquo;s graphql-faker. In one screen you write the schema, and in the other you try what you\u0026rsquo;ve just written, including the help text or documentation you\u0026rsquo;ve just created.\nFurthermore GraphQL schemas support inheritance, we can use the same objects for different queries. For example, in our business domain, and in most businesses for that matter, we have to return the price of the Hotel, or Flight. We can use exactly the same element in both, and just extend it if needed. This makes the job much easier and faster for the developer who\u0026rsquo;s implementing our service.\nBuilding Queries  Componentes de la query Componentes de la respuesta Respuesta Como lo hacemos Paginacion  Building Mutations  Componentes de la query Componentes de la respuesta Respuesta Como lo hacemos Paginacion  TODO: Falta chicha!!
