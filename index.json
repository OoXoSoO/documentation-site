	"content": " Overview ConnectX is the ultimate connectivity solution, it not only connects you to multiple suppliers, but also adds business logic solving most of the problems commonly found in the travel business in an elegant and efficient way.\n Each and every layer discribed in the this figure is explained as follows:\nGraphQL Gateway ConnectX is the first-in-the-industry travel API completely based in GraphQL. Most travel APIs are old legacy XML Soap APIs. We know that, because we\u0026rsquo;ve integrated too many of them. The problems with that technology are well-known and we won\u0026rsquo;t get into details here. One of the things we really like about GraphQL, is that each client is ultimately responsible over what it wants to be returned. For the full reasoning behind working with GraphQL please click here.\nThe architecture doest not differ from many modern APIs. There\u0026rsquo;s an API Gateway, which takes care of basic stuff like authentication and authorization. It also acts like a shield protecting us from DoS attacks and handles throttling. Analytics takes also an important part in the gateway. Moreover, our Gateway is the only endpoint to access all of our APIs.\nIt is written in NodeJS, fast, stable, secure and fault tolerant load balanced between many datacenters from 4 different cloud providers, namely Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Hetzner and TotalUptime.\nBusiness Logic We\u0026rsquo;ve added a new layer of business logic in front of the pure transformation API, very fast and totally scalable. It\u0026rsquo;s very flexible, everything can be overridden at the request level, or be left as is. The API is completely written in Go and Redis for performance and scalability. There\u0026rsquo;s also the possibility of writing plugins (in Go) in order to add any logic or add an extra functionality. The main funcionalities of the business logic layer includes, but not limited to:\n Configuration and access management Hotel Mapping Room Type Mapping Sort \u0026amp; Filter results Add pricing/markups Currency Exchange Plugins  Plugins ConnectX introduces a new concept to the industry: Plugins. In a nutshell, a plugin is a piece of code that is executed inside our application. There are a few points in the request lifetime where anyone can develop a plugin. It receives the request or response as an input and outputs the changed request or response. Plugins are a core package in the Go Programming language and more info about it can be found here.\nFor more information and how to write and build plugins please go to the relevant ConnectX Plugin Documentation Page: Hotel or Flight.\nTransformation The transformation layer takes care of the actual trasformation into the supplier\u0026rsquo;s specific format and back. It generates requests to the supplier in an optimal way, we call it Optimal Connector. The Optimal connector is the result of years of interacting with the suppliers and learning from them and from experience how to send requests to them. Each different supplier has a different logic, and is more efficient in one way. We use this now how to send exactly the request which the supplier will handle more effectively, being that a per hotel list, or destination or anythign that over the time we0ve learned from their responses. The transformation layer keeps each and every supplier integration in an optimal level. If a new version is released, we will update our integration. Our team is constantly monitoring the traffic, both automatically and manually in order to make sure the connectivity just works.\n[Optional] Cache Layer Our cache layer, called Speed does exactly what the name says, it caches results so that we don\u0026rsquo;t knock out the suppliers. From a high level perspective it is just a cache. Our secret sauce is how we expire the cache. We use advanced Machine Learning models to predict how long each cached item will be valid from taking into account a large number of variables set in the request. The cache is hosted in Google\u0026rsquo;s BigTable, a \u0026ldquo;Massively Scalable NoSQL\u0026rdquo; database built with performance and scalability in mind.\nSuppliers Each and every supplier works in a different way. Most are old, legacy SOAP APIs, very few are RESTful APIs and none of them is GraphQL. We have developed them all, and suffered learned from all of them.\nWe connect seemlessly to more than 600 suppliers.\n"

	"content": " A query language for your API Designed by Facebook, GraphQL is a new way of dealing and managing APIs, specially useful for decoupling client\u0026rsquo;s from server\u0026rsquo;s logic.\nStraight from the horse\u0026rsquo;s mouth:  A GraphQL query is a string that is sent to a server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client. Lee Byron, Facebook\n Official Definition  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. graphql.org\n More specifically:  GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn\u0026rsquo;t tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. graphql.org/learn\n GraphQL at travelgateX GraphQL is a perfect fit for each and every need of our applications:\n Scalable: we must be able to handle millions of requests. Stable: a change in the API must not break the client. Fast: GraphQL not only allows faster response times by letting you choose exactly what you want, but also is consumes less bandwidth which makes responses lighter.  We\u0026rsquo;re a company focused in providing APIs for our clients. SOAP APIs are long gone and modelling REST APIs to fit a vast variety of products is not only hard, but the bigger it gets, the more unmanageable it becomes.\nAt travelgateX, we\u0026rsquo;re true believers of the Kaisen philosophy. We\u0026rsquo;re constantly researching for new ways of improvement.\n GraphQL allows us to think of our APIs as a whole, giving a coherence in all our products \u0026amp; services, accessible from one single endpoint. It\u0026rsquo;s like a showcase for our APIs. Oscar Perez, CTO\n "

	"content": " Queries and Mutations  At its simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by looking at a very simple query and the result we get when we run it http://graphql.org/learn/queries/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com\n There are 2 basic operations in GraphQL schemas:\nQueries http://graphql.org/learn/queries/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com\nJust like a RESTful Get method, queries query the system. This operation reads values from the server using a Graph Object and gets a JSON as a response.\nUnlike a RESTful service, queries are interactive, it allows the user to choose exactly what he wants to get returned. This way, if the API owner makes a change to the API, the client will not be affected as long as the query does not change. Think of it like a good\u0026rsquo;ol SQL query. As long as you send the same one, the results is always predictable.\nThis fact makes versioning totally unnecessary in GraphQL APIs. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to specify which version you want to consume, since it\u0026rsquo;s you who are in charge of deciding which fields you want to retrieve.\nAs a bonus, the GraphQL specification includes handling of deprecated fields and marks a field as is-deprecated by adding a deprecationReason to the field.\nQuery example\nEJEMPLO PEQUE DE DISPO TODO: Falta ejemplo!! Mutations http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com\nMutations are methods that change the server. It makes a physical change to the data. Could be inserting a new object in a database, deleting or updating. Queries take care of POST, PUT and DELETE methods in a REST API or INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE in SQL.\nMutation example:\n"

	"content": " A Paradigm Shift GraphQL is a query language, and as such it does exactly that: it queries servers in order to get results back. And we get to choose exactly what data we want to retrieve. As opposed to JSON, each piece of data has its own type, so we get to know exactly what to expect, it\u0026rsquo;s a typed language. This gives it a lot of predictability, something we can really appreciate, especially when dealing with third party APIs, where we have no control of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the other side.\nBuilding GraphQL Schemas In GraphQL, the API specifications are called schemas. A GraphQL Schema is like a contract between the client and the server. It\u0026rsquo;s the definition of how they talk to each other, what they expect from each other so each of them can know exactly what they can and cannot send to each other and what they\u0026rsquo;ll get in response to that. This makes a lot of a difference when creating our schemas, we have to get used to think in a Schema First way.\n A particularly interesting pattern seems to be emerging. Over and over again, I hear developers describing a way of approaching product development we’re calling “GraphQL First.”https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-first-a-better-way-to-build-modern-apps-b5a04f7121a0\n First, we model our data, thinking of all the different uses we can give to it. And only then, we\u0026rsquo;ll think of where we going to get it from. It could even be from different services, like a database and another node from a third party provider.\nAnother great feature is that the GraphQL specification ensures we write documentation while writing the schema. Apart from being really cool to see your text in the GraphiQL window while you\u0026rsquo;re typing your query, it really helps you to think of each and every node and why you\u0026rsquo;re putting it there. We use APIs Guru\u0026rsquo;s graphql-faker. In one screen you write the schema, and in the other you try what you\u0026rsquo;ve just written, including the help text or documentation you\u0026rsquo;ve just created.\nFurthermore GraphQL schemas support inheritance, we can use the same objects for different queries. For example, in our business domain, and in most businesses for that matter, we have to return the price of the Hotel, or Flight. We can use exactly the same element in both, and just extend it if needed. This makes the job much easier and faster for the developer who\u0026rsquo;s implementing our service.\nTravelgateX schema implementation follow practices explained here\nBuilding Queries  Componentes de la query Componentes de la respuesta Respuesta Como lo hacemos Paginacion  Building Mutations  Componentes de la query Componentes de la respuesta Respuesta Como lo hacemos Paginacion  TODO: Falta chicha!!

	"content": " Using the API The two types of allowed operations in TravelgateX GraphQL API are:\n Queries Mutations  For more information about using a GraphQL API click here.\nGraphQL Endpoint One of the great things we love about GraphQL is that there\u0026rsquo;s only one single endpoint. Use this endpoint for all operations you want to perform:\nhttps://api.travelgatex.com Communicate with GraphQL Server To communicate with the GraphQL server, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an access token with the right scopes.\nThis access token could be an API Key or a JSON Web Token, and the correct way to send it to GraphQL server is via HTTP Header:\n API key: \u0026quot;Authorization: Apikey xxxxxxxxx\u0026quot; JWT: \u0026quot;Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxx\u0026quot;  Follow the steps in Creating an access token to create a token.\nMaking Requests Because GraphQL operations consist of multiple operations and schemas, we recommend using the Explorer to make GraphQL calls. There are some alternatives to use GraphQL builtin explorer like GraphQL Playground. You can also use cURL or any other HTTP-speaking library.\nAll LIVE traffic MUST enable GZIP compression in the HTTP header Accept-Encoding: gzip  To query GraphQL using cURL, make a POST request with a JSON payload. The payload must contain a string called query:\ncurl -X\\ POST\\ -H \u0026quot;Content-Type: application/json\u0026quot; \\ -H \u0026quot;Authorization: Apikey q8ggxpoVDW76Kw918hwnnRvxlZmAP2QZ\u0026quot; \\ --data '{\u0026quot;query\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{searchStatusService{code description}}\u0026quot;}' \\ --compressed \\ https://api.travelgatex.com  Examples We share GraphQL Playgrounds with common scenarios using products. Playgrounds are shared in product reference sections, for example you can use ConnectX Hotel Playground\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to use the correct Headers. If you want to use test headers, insert \u0026quot;Authorization\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Apikey q8ggxpoVDW76Kw918hwnnRvxlZmAP2QZ\u0026quot;\nYou can easily share your Queries with others by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Share\u0026rdquo; button and sharing the generated link. You can think about GraphQL Bin like Pastebin for your GraphQL queries including the context (endpoint, HTTP headers, open tabs etc).\nConventions TravelgateX follow some conventions about schema definition:\n Relay schema requirements Definition of custom scalar types Token Based Authentication  Relay Implementation TravelgateX uses Relay schema requirements for own Resources. Other resources, like supplier search response, are not modeled with Relay practices.\nRelay helps travelgateX API in order to standarize:\n Standards for querying paginated collections (\u0026ldquo;Connections\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Edges\u0026rdquo;) Identifying objects directly from the root of a query (avoiding long nested queries) Provide mutation input data  Custom Scalar Types TravelgateX GraphQL schema implementation defines custom scalar types.\nJSON Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to manage arbitrary JSON values for loosely structured data. The JSON type makes sure that it is actually valid JSON and returns the value as a parsed JSON object/array instead of a string.\nIn queries or mutations, JSON fields have to be specified with enclosing double quotes. Special characters have to be escaped: \u0026quot;{\\\u0026quot;int\\\u0026quot;: 1, \\\u0026quot;string\\\u0026quot;: \\\u0026quot;value\\\u0026quot;}\u0026quot;.\nDateTime The DateTime type represents DateTime values. A good example might be a transaction TimeSpan.\nIn queries or mutations, DateTime fields have to be specified in ISO 8601 format with enclosing double quotes: \u0026quot;2017-10-22T13:57:31.123Z\u0026quot;.\nDate The Date type represents Date values. A good example might be a Hotel CheckIn Date.\nIn queries or mutations, DateTime fields have to be specified in ISO 8601 format with enclosing double quotes: \u0026quot;2017-10-22\u0026quot;.\nURI The URI type represents a URI values. A good example mith be an Hotel Image URL.\nIn queries or mutations, URI fields have to be specified in RFC 3986, RFC 3987, and RFC 6570 (level 4) compliant URI string format with enclosing double quotes: \u0026quot;http:\\\\www.travelgatex.com\u0026quot;.\nCountry The Country type represents Country values. A good example might be a Passenger Nationality.\nIn queries or mutations, Country fields have to be specified in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format with enclosing double quotes \u0026quot;ES\u0026quot;.\nLanguage The Language type represents Language values. A good example might be a Hotel Description Language.\nIn queries or mutations, Language fields have to be specified in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format with enclosing double quotes \u0026quot;es\u0026quot;.\nCurrency The Currenty type represents Currency values. A good example might be a Rate Price Currency.\nIn queries or mutations, Currency fields have to be specified in ISO 4217 format with enclosing double quotes \u0026quot;EUR\u0026quot;.\n"

	"content": "  GraphQL Overview A query language for your API Designed by Facebook, GraphQL is a new way of dealing and managing APIs, specially useful for decoupling client\u0026rsquo;s from server\u0026rsquo;s logic. Straight from the horse\u0026rsquo;s mouth: A GraphQL query is a string that is sent to a server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client. Lee Byron, Facebook Official Definition GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.\n Basic Concepts Queries and Mutations At its simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by looking at a very simple query and the result we get when we run it http://graphql.org/learn/queries/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com There are 2 basic operations in GraphQL schemas: Queries http://graphql.org/learn/queries/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com Just like a RESTful Get method, queries query the system. This operation reads values from the server using a Graph Object and gets a JSON as a response.\n Thinking in GraphQL A Paradigm Shift GraphQL is a query language, and as such it does exactly that: it queries servers in order to get results back. And we get to choose exactly what data we want to retrieve. As opposed to JSON, each piece of data has its own type, so we get to know exactly what to expect, it\u0026rsquo;s a typed language. This gives it a lot of predictability, something we can really appreciate, especially when dealing with third party APIs, where we have no control of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the other side.\n Tooling Tooling Please find below a collection of tools we\u0026rsquo;ve been using to help us develop in GraphQL.
