      <description>Do I have access to all the hotels in the test environment? No, we use a test supplier, so there is a limited number of hotels in the data base to be used.
Which are the languages allowed in HotelX? The new aggregator allows each language, it will depend from each supplier.
How many hotels code are allowed to request at the same time? We recommend a maximum of 200 hotels, the new aggregator will split to each supplier the maximum hotels allowed in different batches in order to request to the supplier all the hotels.</description>
